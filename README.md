Android Password Manager is a Android app that stores all your username and passwords from all the sites you use. This way, you won't forget any of your user information and can access it anywhere, anytime. It uses Amazon Web Services to host your information and the front end device never stores any of your data. 

All you need to do is to create an account and "add" your website/content, username and password and you can view all of them at any time.
